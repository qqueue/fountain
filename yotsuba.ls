# @requests, @responses, and @ready attachment buses are suitable for use with
# the Limiter in order to respect 4chan's API rules.
#
# Since 4chan doesn't have a single endpoint that gives the entire view of
# a given board, we either have to poll the catalog until all the threads with
# more than 5 posts since we started are pruned, or we can poll less frequently
# to start and request individual threads.
#
# Eventually, we should get to a state where we can keep up with all the
# changes just from the catalog endpoint, only ocassionally having to pull
# a full thread to find out which posts were deleted (or if a thread is so
# popular that there are more than 5 posts before we poll again).
